# üß† Agentic Code Analyzer

Agentic Code Analyzer is an AI-powered coding assistant that **analyzes Python code**, detects errors, computes complexity, executes safely in a sandbox, and provides **LLM-based improvement suggestions** using Google Gemini API ‚Äî all through an elegant web interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üß© **Syntax Analysis** ‚Äì Detects syntax errors and invalid code structures  
- üß† **Static Analysis** ‚Äì Integrates with Pylint & Mypy for type and lint checks  
- üìä **Complexity Analysis** ‚Äì Evaluates cyclomatic complexity for performance insights  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Secure Execution** ‚Äì Runs user code in a sandboxed environment  
- üí¨ **AI Suggestions (Gemini)** ‚Äì Explains, fixes, and improves code intelligently  
- üé® **Modern UI** ‚Äì Sleek, minimal interface for smooth code analysis

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Frontend (Vercel)**  
   Users paste Python code into the web interface and click *Analyze Code*.  
2. **Backend (Render)**  
   - Receives the code through a FastAPI endpoint (`/analyze`)  
   - Runs syntax, static, and complexity checks  
   - Executes code safely in a sandbox  
   - Calls **Gemini API** for natural-language analysis  
3. **Frontend displays results**  
   The output includes syntax validation, execution output, AI suggestions, and complexity score.

## üß† Example Output

```

üß† Agentic Code Analyzer
def read_file(filename):
try:
with open(filename, "r") as f:
return f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
return "File not found!"

print(read_file("test.txt"))

Analyze Code
üß© Syntax Check:
‚úÖ No errors
üß† Static Analysis:
Pylint & Mypy report: Success: no issues found
üìä Complexity:
Average = 2
‚öôÔ∏è Execution Output:
File not found!
üí° Gemini Suggestions:
This code is correct and executes as expected. No bugs detected.

```

## üîí Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (not committed to GitHub):

```

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` before committing.

## üß† Future Enhancements

- Add support for **multi-language code analysis**  
- Integrate **real-time AI explanations** while typing  
- Add **code refactoring and optimization metrics**  
- Include **user authentication and history tracking**
